        text: "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles). It is a rocky planet with a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Mercury has a barren, heavily cratered surface, resembling the Moon, due to its lack of an atmosphere to protect it from meteor impacts. Temperatures on Mercury vary drastically, ranging from scorching highs of about 430째C (800째F) during the day to freezing lows of -180째C (-290째F) at night. The planet has a very thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off its surface by solar winds. Despite being closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet; that title belongs to Venus due to its thick atmosphere.",

    "mars": {
        text: "MARS, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the RED PLANET due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Slightly more than half the size of Earth, Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface temperatures ranging from extremely cold to moderately warm. It is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the longest canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars has been a focal point of space exploration due to its potential for past or present life, as well as its accessibility for future human colonization. Scientists have discovered evidence of ancient riverbeds and seasonal water flows, fueling interest in its geology and climate.",

Discovered in 2005, Makemake is one of the largest known objects in this distant region and is roughly two-thirds the size of Pluto. It is composed mainly of rock and ice and has a reddish appearance due to its surface covered in methane and other compounds. Makemake is also notable for having no known moons, making it unique compared to some other dwarf planets. Its orbit takes it approximately 305 years to complete, and it remains a subject of interest for astronomers studying the outer solar system.",

It has a diameter of approximately 3,474 kilometers and is about one-quarter the size of Earth. The moon plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt, which affects the planet's climate. Its surface is marked by craters, seas (maria), and mountains, largely formed by ancient volcanic activity and asteroid impacts. The moon has no atmosphere, leading to extreme temperature variations and a lack of weather. Its phases, from new moon to full moon, are a result of its changing position relative to Earth and the Sun..",
