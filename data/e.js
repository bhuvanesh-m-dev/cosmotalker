        text: "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It is a unique terrestrial planet with a diverse environment, featuring vast oceans, continents, and a protective atmosphere rich in oxygen and nitrogen. With a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers, Earth rotates on its axis, resulting in day and night, and orbits the Sun, creating seasons. Its magnetic field shields the planet from harmful solar radiation, while its biosphere sustains a remarkable variety of life forms. Often called the BLUE PLANET due to its abundant water, Earth is a dynamic system where geological and biological processes continuously shape its surface and ecosystems.",

    text:"Eris, a dwarf planet located in the outer reaches of our solar system, is one of the most massive known trans-Neptunian objects. It was discovered in 2005 by astronomer Mike Brown and is named after the Greek goddess of discord and strife. Eris orbits the Sun at a distance greater than Pluto, and its orbit is highly elliptical, taking it as far as 97 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun. It has a diameter of about 2,326 kilometers, slightly smaller than Pluto, but it is more massive. Eris also has one known moon, Dysnomia. Due to its size and distant orbit, it played a role in the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet.",
