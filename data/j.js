        text:"Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is known for its striking features, including its iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 92 moons, the largest of which are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Its rapid rotation gives it a distinctive oblate shape, and its dynamic atmosphere features colorful bands and storms. Jupiter plays a crucial role in shaping the solar system's dynamics due to its immense size and gravitational influence.",
