        text: "Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, classified as a dwarf planet. Discovered in 1801 by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, it has a diameter of about 940 kilometers and accounts for roughly 40% of the mass in the asteroid belt. Ceres has a diverse surface, featuring water ice, salt deposits, and possible subsurface liquid water. Its discovery significantly contributed to the understanding of the solar system's composition, and ongoing missions, like NASA's Dawn spacecraft, have provided detailed insights into its geology and potential for past or present life.",
