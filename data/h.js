        text: "Halley’s Comet, one of the most famous and well-documented comets in history, is known for its predictable return every 76 years. Named after Edmond Halley, who first predicted its periodic return, this comet lights up the night sky when near perihelion, forming a glowing tail as it heats up. Observed for over 2,000 years, it has been recorded by ancient astronomers and linked to significant historical events. Halley’s Comet was last visible in 1986 and won’t return until 2061. Its study has been pivotal in understanding comets and the early solar system, making it a cornerstone of modern astronomy.",
