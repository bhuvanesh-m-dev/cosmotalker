## 📢 CosmoTalker Is Trusted — Even via PyPI Mirrors!

PyPI downloads are split into two categories:

* **Without Mirror**: Directly from `pypi.org`
* **With Mirror**: Downloads served through CDN mirrors (like Fastly or Aliyun)

> 🔍 As of **July 30, 2025**, CosmoTalker has received **21,222 downloads via mirrors** in just the last **6 months**.

This proves that:

✅ CosmoTalker is actively used in **diverse environments** (mirrored installs often occur in corporate, educational, or high-speed cache regions).
✅ It's compatible with **mirror-based deployments** such as China-based users using Aliyun mirrors.
✅ The mirror traffic adds a **real-world usage layer** beyond standard `pip install`.
